	<h1 class="pageTitle">About this site</h1>
    
    <p>This site is a exploratory and very much a work in progress! I'm hoping it becomes a place to share modular, practical, and well-designed approaches to teaching research skills and writing techniques. The focus is on research at UCLA, but many of these tips will be useful for anyone taking on a research project.</p>
    
    <p>Hope you find the site useful!</p>
