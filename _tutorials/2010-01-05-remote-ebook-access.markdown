<p class="intro">Need a book? We've got you covered! Follow this roadmap to find e-Books on reserve and through UCLA Library. Haven't found it yet? No problem! We'll also show you how to search HathiTrust's Temporary Expanded Access Service, a collaboration of academic libraries preserving a massive collection of scanned books from around the world. UCLA students, faculty, and staff currently have temporary expanded access to UC library books collected by the HathiTrust Digital Library. This means that if any UC library has a book in print and in the HathiTrust, you can get temporary access to it electronically through the HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service. Thatâ€™s more than 7 million books! And, we haven't reached the end of the road quite yet! There's also the National Emergency Library, Interlibrary Loan, and getting in touch with the library.</p>
