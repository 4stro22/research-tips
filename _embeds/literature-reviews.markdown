	<h3>Creating Literature Reviews</h3>
	<p>Literature reviews are great resources for research projects in all disciplines, presenting the key ideas in a field, pointing to must-read articles, and sugesting directions for future research. How do you go about writing one, though?</p>
	<p>Continue for resources and tips for creating your own literature review.</p>

	<h3>Creating a Literature Review</h3>
	<p>This first video takes you on an outer space journey with different disciplines at UCLA, introducing how to create a literature review and what you can do with it when itâ€™s done.</p>

	<h3>A Literature Review is More Than a Summary</h3>
	<p>Literature reviews are more than a collection of summaries: they analyze connections and disagreements between sources, identify gaps in the collective knowledge, and more. Check out the video below for more information.</p>

	<h3>Types of Literature Reviews</h3>
	<p>As mentioned in the first video, literature reviews can take different shapes based on your research needs. You can either have a narrow or broad focus, and the finished piece can stand on its own or be part of a bigger project.</p>

	<h3>Skimming for What You Need<h3>
	<p><i>Adapted from UCLA Professor Snowden Becker's <a href="https://snowdenbecker.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/how-to-read-an-article_2016.pdf">"How to Read an Article"</a>.</i></p>
	<ul class="browser-default activator">
		<li><b>Start at the ends.</b> Important information is usually concentrated in the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the piece. From this quick scan, you can likely tell if this resource is important to your research and merits inclusion in your literature review.</li>
		<li><b>Look for landmarks.</b> Journal articles generally follow a set structure with titled subsections like <i>Problem Statement</i> or <i>Research Methods &amp; Design</i> that allow you to skip to the content you need.</li>
		<li><b>Take notes as you go.</b> While you may remember the central argument or findings of a resource now, after you look through a whole body of research you may lose the nuances of individual pieces. Important things to keep track of may include central ideas, research methods, referenced works, and refuted or counter-argued ideas. </li></ul>
