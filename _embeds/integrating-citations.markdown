			<p>Now that you've done your research, it's time to cite your sources. We sampled several academic papers to show you a variety of ways you can integrate your sources into your own writing. Use these strategies to diversify your writing and show your readers how your sources contributed to your work! Our examples follow the APA style guidelines.</p>

		<h3>Make a claim without a quote.</h3>
		<p>Oftentimes you do not need to directly quote a source to convey its conclusions or arguments – and some disciplines discourage quoting directly! Rather you can paraphrase the main point of a paper in your own words and provide an in-text citation. A benefit of using this strategy is that you can offer support for a claim without using a whole paragraph to introduce and frame a quote. You should make sure that you fully understand the paper's argument and that you are following university citation guidelines before attempting to paraphrase something from a paper.

		<h3>Make a claim that is supported by two or more sources.</h3>
		<p> Sometimes there’s not just one source that perfectly supports your claim, or there are two major publications that deserve credit for providing evidence on a topic. This is a perfect time to use multiple citations. You can cite two, three, or more sources, but remember to cite only the publications that are most prominent so as not to clutter up your paper.</p>
