			<p>Now that you've done your research, it's time to cite your sources. We sampled several academic papers to show you a variety of ways you can integrate your sources into your own writing. Use these strategies to diversify your writing and show your readers how your sources contributed to your work! Our examples follow the APA style guidelines.</p>

		<h3>Make a claim without a quote.</h3>
		<p>Oftentimes you do not need to directly quote a source to convey its conclusions or arguments – and some disciplines discourage quoting directly! Rather you can paraphrase the main point of a paper in your own words and provide an in-text citation. A benefit of using this strategy is that you can offer support for a claim without using a whole paragraph to introduce and frame a quote. You should make sure that you fully understand the paper's argument and that you are following university citation guidelines before attempting to paraphrase something from a paper.

		<h3>Make a claim that is supported by two or more sources.</h3>
		<p><markgreen>Claim</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation 1</markyellow>; <markyellow>Citation 2</markyellow>).</p>
		<h4>Example:</h4>
		<p class="two"> <markgreen>Reviews of this literature concede difficulty in making direct comparisons of emission levels across different sets of analysis</markgreen> (<markyellow>Bader and Bleischwitz, 2009</markyellow>; <markyellow>Kennedy et al., 2009</markyellow>; <markyellow>Ramaswami et al., 2012</markyellow>). </p>

		<h3>Make a claim that is supported by two or more sources.</h3>
		<p> Sometimes there’s not just one source that perfectly supports your claim, or there are two major publications that deserve credit for providing evidence on a topic. This is a perfect time to use multiple citations. You can cite two, three, or more sources, but remember to cite only the publications that are most prominent so as not to clutter up your paper.</p>

		<h3>Make a claim that has been supported in multiple contexts.</h3>
		<p> <markgreen>Context 1</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>), <markgreen>Context 2</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>), <markgreen>Context 3</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>). </p>
		<h4>Example:</h4>
		<p class="two"> <markgreen>These results are supported by more recent research on transportation energy consumption</markgreen>  (<markyellow>Liddle, 2014</markyellow>), <markgreen>electricity consumption in buildings</markgreen> (<markyellow>Lariviere and Lafrance, 1999</markyellow>), <markgreen>and overall urban GHG emissions</markgreen> (<markyellow>Marcotullio et al., 2013b</markyellow>). </p>

		<h3>Make a claim that has been supported in multiple contexts.</h3>
		<p>Use this citation strategy when you want to show that a body of research has found support for some claim across several different contexts. This can show the robustness of an effect or phenomenon and can give your claim some added validity.</p>

		<h3>Quote important or unique terms.</h3>
		<p> <markgreen>Claim</markgreen> "<markyellow>Term</markyellow>"(<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>).</p>
		<h4>Example:</h4>
		<p class="two"><markgreen>The spatial implications of this thinking are manifest in the</markgreen> "<markyellow>concentric ring model</markyellow>" <markgreen>of urban expansion and its variants</markgreen> (<markyellow>Harris and Ullman, 1945</markyellow>)</p>

		<h3>Quote important or unique terms.</h3>
		<p>While block or even whole-sentence citations are rare in most research papers in the science and social science disciplines, there is often a need to quote specific terms or phrases that were first coined by a certain source or that were well-explained in a specific paper.</p>

		<h3>Use a direct quotation.</h3>
		<p><markgreen>Introduce quote</markgreen>, "<markyellow>Quotation</markyellow>." (<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>)</p>
		<h4>Example:</h4>
		<p class="two"><markgreen>China’s </markgreen> "<markyellow>radical</markyellow>” <markgreen>urbanization has underpinned the country’s economicgrowth and has been key to the nation’s economic growth strategy</markgreen> (<markyellow>McGranahan et al., 2014</markyellow>)</p>

		<h3>Use a direct quotation.</h3>
		<p>The appropriateness of quoting directly from a text varies widely across fields and document types. However, if it makes sense for your field and your purpose, a direct quotation can bring attention to specific language in your source.</p>
