## What's on your mind and how can we help?

WI+RE has been working quickly over the past few weeks to pivot into remote collaboration and communication mode! We are up and running and ready to help.

Please let us know your thoughts on our upcoming projects and next steps. We would love to hear more about how we can help with synchronous and asynchronous remote learning.

## How to integrate WI+RE workshops into your courses

Want to integrate WI+RE workhshops directly into your own webpage or CCLE course site? No problem! You can follow this [how-to guide from Humtech](https://humtech.ucla.edu/how-to/embed-wire-workshops-in-your-course-site/) or [contact us directly](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/contact/)!

## New website: CREATES for reading and analyzing science articles

WI+RE is thrilled to announce that through our collaboration with Jordan Moberg Parker, Director of Undergraduate Laboratory Curriculum and Assessment in Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, we're launching the CREATES website!

C.R.E.A.T.E.S. is a set of 6 steps that help learners read and critically analyze scientific papers. The C.R.E.A.T.E.S. method, pioneered by Dr. Sally Hoskins, has a demonstrated positive impact on undergraduate students self-confidence in scientific reading, as well as in their general perceptions of and beleifs about science and scientific thinking (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.11-03-0027" target="_blank">Hoskins, et. al, 2017</a>).

Many thanks to Dr. Jordan Moberg Parker for serving as the Pedagogy Lead on this project, for providing the initial set of instructional materials and examples of student work, and for contributing countless hours providing feedback and advice to make the project possible! BIG, big, big congratulations to Kian and Alex for authoring the website and creating the multimedia! And we are also very grateful to our many project contributors: Salma Abumeeiz, Giselle Burns, Juan DÃ­az, Taylor Harper, Royson Lin, Christopher Lopez, Renee Romero, Hannah Sutherland, and April Zhou! Thank you for all the help along the way!

## New Workshops Series: Entering Research

WI+RE recently launched three new workshops as part of the new [Entering Research](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/#entering-research-workshops) Workshop series. This series of workshops comes as a result of our ongoing partnership with the Undergraduate Research Centers!

The three new workshops include essential tips on [Beginning Your Research Journey](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/beginning-your-research-journey/), getting to know [Research Logistics](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/research-logistics/) at UCLA, as well as a very practical workshop on [Finding a Research Mentor](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/finding-a-mentor-or-project/).

Please take a look and let us know your feedback! We are currently looking for instructors and programs that would like to integrate these workshops!

### Newly accepted to PRIMO

This January, WI+RE's online research workshop [Writing a Literature Review](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/workshops/writing-a-literature-review/) was selected for the ALA/ACRL Instruction Section's Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online [PRIMO database](http://www.ala.org/cfapps/primo/public/search.cfm ).

(workshop thumbnail + PRIMO logo)

Writing a Literature Review workshop offers tips for students to recognize key compoents of a literature review,  identify research gaps, and synthesize sources. It takes the form of interactive slides that include videos, examples, and various forms of assessments. Along with many other WI+RE tutorials and workshops on research and writing, it can be accessed publicly through the [WI+RE website](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/), or incorporated directly into any UCLA CCLE course.

The project was co-authered by WI+RE's student designers Kian Ravaei and Taylor Harper, and made possible by the collaborations of contributors from across campus, including Whitney Arnold, Janet Goins, Fernando Gomez, Leigh Harris, Christine Holten, Caitlin Meyer, Nisha Mody, Shannon Roux, Doug Worsham, April Zhou, and Renee Romero. Big thanks to everyone and congratulations!

The PRIMO committee has also invited WI+RE for a "Site of the Month" interview to feature our project. The interview will be posted on their website in the future. Stay tuned!

## Work in progress!

### Writing Tips with the Undergraduate Writing Center PLFs

We are very excited about our ongoing collaboration with the Writing Center Peer Learning Facilitators (PLFs). We're currently working with Christine Holten, UG Writing Center Director, and the PLF team to create a series of writing tips tutorials. Last quarter, the PLFs collaborated with WI+RE to identify top writing challenges from their experience helping writers at UCLA, and now we're working on storyboards and scripts. It should be a great series!

### New project ideas from Library staff

Library staff from across UCLA have shared a large set of ideas for future projects on everything from using images as evidence, to finding open data sources, to navigating finding aids and searching for primary sources. We're thrilled with this big collection of new ideas and looking forward to next steps! Get ready to empathy map and make learning outcomes!
