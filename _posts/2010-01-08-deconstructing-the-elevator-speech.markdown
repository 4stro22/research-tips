<p class="intro"> You've spent weeks, months, and maybe even years working on a research project that you are proud of. You know why this project is important and what your next steps will be, but are you prepared to explain all of that to the next person who asks you about your research? You should take some time now and create an elevator speech to pitch in these situations.</p>

<h4>So what is an elevator speech?</h4>

<p>In a research setting, an elevator speech introduces you as a researcher, your research questions, and teh significance of your reserach. Because an elevator speech is short, typically 30 seconds to 2 minutes, it is a great way to introduce and share your research with others at formal networking events, conferences, casual conversations, or even during an actual elevator ride.</p>
<p> Ultimately, your elevator speech should provide a 'hook' and make your listener want to know more about your research! </p>

<h4>Delivering an Elevator Speech</h4>
<p>It's important to <b><i> consider whom your audience is </i></b> when delivering an elevator speech. For instance, it's a good idea to leave out jargon if you're pitching your research project to a lay audience as opposed to a group of experts in your field. 

<p>Here's an example of how you can edit a technical and jargon-heavy passage so it's more suitable for a wider audience. </p>

<p> Remember to keep it simple and to the point. State your research topic, report your findings, and convey its significance. It's a good idea to write out a draft first and read it out loud a few times to make sure it flows and is of appropriate length. </p>
<p>And most importantly, <b><i> practice </i></b>delivering your elevator speech a lot. This will help calm your nerves so you don't freeze up when you're about to share your research with others. To make your elevator speech not sound robotic, it's a good idea to memorize key points of your research rather than a full script. </p>
<p>And lastly, be <b><i> enthusiastic. </i></b> Recall what first sparked your interest in your research and be sure to convey that to your audience. </p>

<h4>What's the difference between an elevator speech and an abstract?</h4>
<p>Although both serve to present your research and its significance in a concise manner, elevator speeches and abstracts differ in format and purpose. </p>
