<p class="intro">Set up your computer to access library resources from off-campus.</p>

<p class="flow-text">The Library's online subscription resources (databases, electronic journals, or e-books) can always be accessed from computers and wireless networks on campus. However, to access these resources from off-campus, you will need to set up your computer with either *proxy* or *VPN*. Don't worry, it is easy, and both the library and the staff at Bruin OnLine can help.</p>
