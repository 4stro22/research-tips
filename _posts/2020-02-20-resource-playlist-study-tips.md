Are you excited to be in a fun and interesting class? Trying your best to learn and understand material you need to know later? Or do you just want to do well on your exams? Whatever your learning goals are, here is a playlist of some study tips backed by cognitive science that are endorsed by WI+RE. Use them to your full advantage!

            <h5 class="card-title">Space It Out</h5>
	    <p class="card-text">Hundreds of studies have shown that spacing, or spreading out study sessions with gaps in between, is far better for remembering the studied material than massing, or cramming as it is more commonly known. This is known as the <i>spacing effect</i>.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Test Yourself</h5>
	    <p class="card-text">Many studies have also shown that testing yourself on content you've just read or watched actually helps you remember it way better than simply rereading or rewatching the material. This is known as the <i>testing effect</i>. One strong hypothesis about why it works is because testing yourself is a form of retrieval practice, or training yourself to recall something, which is the exact thing you need to do come test time!</p>

            <p class="card-text">You may have heard of the idea of having a single dedicated "study spot" that you do all your studying in. Maybe it's your desk at home or a library on campus. However, did you know that you might actually learn better if you switch it up and study in multiple different places? Smith & Rothkopf found that students who took an 8-hour statistics course over four days in four different classrooms did better on a test in a completely new environment compared to students who took the course in the same room. This might be useful for you if you like to study in places that are not the exam location, like most of us!  Check out their study!</p>

            <p class="card-text">Another helpful memory aid is processing the material deeply. This paper by Craik and Lockhart suggests a framework for human memory that stresses the importance of depths or levels of processing and predicts that the deeper information is processed, the longer it will be remembered.</p>
	    <p class="card-text">Interestingly enough, this ties very tightly into understanding the material....</p>
