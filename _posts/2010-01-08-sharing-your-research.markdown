<p class="intro"> <i>You've spent weeks, months, and maybe even years working on a research project that you are proud of. You know why this project is important and what your next steps will be, but are you prepared to explain all of that to the next person who asks you about your research? You should take some time now and create an elevator speech to pitch in these situations.</i> </p>

<h4>So what is an elevator speech?</h4>

<p>In a research setting, an elevator speech introduces you as a researcher, your research questions, and teh significance of your reserach. Because an elevator speech is short, typically 30 seconds to 2 minutes, it is a great way to introduce and share your research with others at formal networking events, conferences, casual conversations, or even during an actual elevator ride.</p>
<p> Ultimately, your elevator speech should provide a 'hook' and make your listener want to know more about your research! </p>
