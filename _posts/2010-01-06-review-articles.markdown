</p>
<p>A review article summarizes the state of research in a specific field and analyzes connections, possible disagreements, and gaps between a range of sources within the field. You can use a review article to get a better understanding of the current state of research on a topic, to identify unanswered research questions, or to find relevant sources. A review article’s bibliography is a fantastic starting point for finding and organizing sources.

### Heads Up:

<p class="flow-text">Unlike typical research articles, review articles do not present any original primary research. For that reason, some assignments may not allow you to directly cite a review article in your paper. However, you can still use the article to get a general understanding of the field and to find important primary research articles.</p>

### How do I Find a Review Articles? 
<p>Finding a review article is relatively simple, though it varies slightly depending on what database you are using. 
</p>

</li>
   <li>*For Google Scholar you simply add the term “review” or “review article” at the end of your search terms. Just be careful to check that your results is really a review article by making sure there is no “methods” or “results” sections.
