<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you’re looking for an efficient way to get an overview of a body of research on your topic, a review article is a great place to start. 
</p>
<p>A review article summarizes the state of research in a specific area, describing connections and disagreements between researchers, and pointing out gaps in knowledge and directions for future research. You can use a review article to get a better understanding of the existing research on a topic, to identify unanswered research questions, and to find relevant sources. A review article’s bibliography often contains references to research articles that have made an impact on the field and advanced understanding of a research topic. 
</p>
<p>Reading a review article will save you time and might ultimately give you a more well-rounded and coherent understanding of your topic.</p>

### Heads Up:

<p>Unlike typical research articles, review articles do not present any original primary research. For that reason, some assignments may not allow you to directly cite a review article in your paper. However, you can still use the article to get a general understanding of the field and to find important primary research articles.</p>

### How do I Find a Review Articles? 

Finding a review article is relatively simple, though it varies slightly depending on what database you are using.

        <p>Be sure to check that your results really are review articles! <!-- I wonder how we can best present multiple ways to distinguish review articles? e.g., by making sure there is no “methods” or “results” sections.--></p>
