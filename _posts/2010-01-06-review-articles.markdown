### What is a Review Article and How Can I Use it?

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you’re looking for an efficient way to get an overview of a body of research on your topic, a review article is a great place to start. 
</p>
<p>A review article summarizes the state of research in a specific field and analyzes connections, possible disagreements, and gaps between a range of sources within the field. You can use a review article to get a better understanding of the current state of research on a topic, to identify unanswered research questions, or to find relevant sources. A review article’s bibliography is a fantastic starting point for finding and organizing sources. 
</p>
<p>Reading a review article will save you time and might ultimately give you a more well-rounded and coherent understanding of your topic.

### Heads Up:

<p class="flow-text">Unlike typical research articles, review articles do not present any original primary research. For that reason, some assignments may not allow you to directly cite a review article in your paper. However, you can still use the article to get a general understanding of the field and to find important primary research articles.</p>
