Every discipline has its own conventions of disciplinary writing. You wouldn't write a biology paper the same way you would write a history paper. Wouldn't it be helpful if there was some handbook on how to write a biology paper?

One of the best ways to improve your writing is by reading good writing. But how do you know what you're reading for, and how do you apply it to your own writing?

Maybe you've just been assigned a paper in a discipline you're not familiar with. Or maybe you're looking to improve your academic writing for *your* discipline.

WI+RE's *Reading for Writing* Style Guide is here to help. The *Reading for Writing* Style Guide is an interactive Google Doc that prompts you to create a toolkit for disciplinary writing by close reading a well-written academic paper. This activity will not only help you identify key technical, rhetorical, and organizational aspects of writing in a certain field, but will also enable you to apply these conventions to your own writing. Open the Google Doc to get started!
