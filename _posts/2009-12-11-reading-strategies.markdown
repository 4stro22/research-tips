<!-- this is a comment, we use comments to write notes that only appear in code -->
<!-- we also use comment to mark off sections of code to make things easier to read and scan -->
<!-- for example, in the code below, there is a start statement and an end statement to help us scan and read through the code. -->

                <ul class="browser-default"><li>Gauge the quantity of reading and the time you have to read it.</li>
                <li>Be honest with yourself about how long your attention span is and how interested you are in the text.</li>
                <li>Schedule breaks or give yourself rewards every few pages or minutes during long reading sessions.</li>
                <li>Find a suitable reading environment, (links to the library, res hall study rooms, etc).</li>

                <p>This strategy will ensure that you acquire relevant knowledge as you read a textbook or journal article.
                <ul class="browser-default"><li>Restate section headings as questions. If the heading is "The Nervous System," your question might be "What is the function of the nervous system?" Another way to practice this technique is turning section headings into questions related to your research topic. For example, a section heading titled, “Youth Social Media Use” could be turned into, “How do youth in different communities use social media? </li>
                <li>As you read and take notes, keep your question in mind. Write down information that answers the question.</li>
                <li>In the end, you should be able to summarize the answer to your question.</li>
                <li>You may need to revise your question if the section content doesn't match up.</li>
