            </div>
            <p class="card-text">Terry Heick explains how students learn by filling and modifying "schemas," or knowledge bases, with new experiences and information they come across. Assimilation refers to the addition of new information to previous bases of knowledge, while accommodation refers to altering previous bases of knowledge to fit new information. Heick outlines the ways in which teachers can make classrooms schema-friendly so that students can direct their own learning experience.</p>

He explains how students differ in how they process information and understand concepts. He offers 20 strategies that can be used by teachers to address different students' needs, such as targeting different senses within lessons and using the Think-Pair-Share social activity.</p>
